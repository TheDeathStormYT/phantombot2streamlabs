# phantombot2streamlabs

Export Phantombot points to Streamlabs.

Streamlabs has points features that are easy to use for streamers. However, many streamers, myself included, use Phantombot for our commands, points, and more.

If you are looking to move out of Phantombot to Streamlabs for your points, here's a tool!


Requirements:
- Python 3 installed (https://www.python.org/ if you do not already have it installed for your OS)


Instructions:
- Put `export_points.py` in your Phantombot* folder. This is the same folder as `Phantombot.jar`.
- On the command line (`cmd.exe` for Windows, `Terminal` for macOS), enter `python export_points.py` and press enter.
- If it was successful, you'll see the following message: `[+] Success! You can upload the points-export.csv file to streamlabs (https://streamlabs.com/dashboard#/accountsettings)!`

**Note:** If you have Phantombot 2.3.9 or above, put `export_points.py` in the `config/` folder
